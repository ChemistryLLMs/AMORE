## Abstract
The recent integration of chemistry with natural language processing (NLP) has advanced drug discovery. Molecule representation in language models (LMs) is crucial in enhancing chemical understanding. We propose Augmented Molecular Retrieval (â™¡AMORE), a flexible zero-shot framework that assesses trustworthiness of Chemical LMs of different natures: trained solely on molecules for chemical tasks
and on a combined corpus of natural language texts and string-based structures. The framework relies on molecule augmentations that preserve an underlying chemical, such as kekulization and cycle replacements. The metric is based on the similarity score between distributed representations of molecules and their augmentations.

## AMORE
AMORE consists of two main parts: data augmentation and ranking by embeddings distance. Augmentations can be applied to every SMILES data. Embeding distance ranking is based on FAISS and is provided both for last lidden state and all layers states. We also provide already augmented dataset files.

## Experimental datasets
Experimental datasets are provided in the folder "data". CHEBI-20 folder contains test part of CHEBI-20 dataset and augmented ones, qm9 folder contains filteret isomeric molecules from qm9 dataset and its augmentations. Every dataset consist of "original" file and four augmented files, created by using augmentation code.

### Augmentations
 ```'./code/augmentation.py'``` creates 4 types of augmentations:
1. rdkit canonicalization
2. explicit addition of hydrogens
3. kekulization
4. replacement of cycle identifiers by random numbers

Each augmentation type creates textual representation of molecule using SMILES syntax rules. All textual representations present the same molecule. Full description and theoretical base of each augmenttion type of are provided in the paper.

### Molecule description task evaluation
 ```"dataset_augmentation_example"``` is an example of data from original dataset augmentation and getting predictions.
 ```"metrics"``` contains example of calculating ROUGE and METEOR between original gold descriptions and predictions on our augmented datasets.

### Last hiddden state evaluation
 ```"eval_faiss.py"``` consist of functions for compute embeddings and metrics of all provided models.
 ```"Last_hidden_state_MRR"``` contains examples of calculating MRR metrics on our datasets and models.
 ```"last_hidden_state_reversed"``` contains examples of calculating acc@1 and acc@5 metrics on our datasets and models.

### All hidden states evaluation
 ```"hidden.py"``` consist of functions for compute embeddings of all layers and metrics of all provided models.
 ```"hidden_states_scifive"``` contains example of calculating acc@1 and acc@5 metrics on our datasets.
